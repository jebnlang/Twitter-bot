Life will always be good to you.","Sounds like a solid checklist for a fulfilling life.

But here's a thought: what happens when life throws curveballs?

Adaptability might be the real MVP. How do you stay resilient when things don't go as planned?"

is like a 50-person company laying off 2 people","When a company scales, the human impact of layoffs doesn't scale down proportionally.  

Each role cut is a unique story and skill set lost.  

How do we ensure the human side of tech isn't overshadowed by numbers?"

Craftsmanship often hides in plain sight. 

Ever wondered how many people are stuck because they think they should already know something simple? 

That's the real opportunity."

- 2x founder turned PM 
- masters in CS 
- ex-collegiate athlete 
- 5’11 
- golden retriever personality 

plz reply or DM I’m so serious","Sounds like a solid resume on paper. 

But here's the real question: How does he treat waitstaff and baristas?  

Character is the real differentiator. 

Curious to see how people define golden retriever personality in real life!"
"2025-05-15T19:12:13.779Z","https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1922644723363119516","Most devs (+ managers, CTOs, etc.) don't realize that the cost of rewriting their messy legacy codebase from the ground up w/ modern tools is probably much lower than they think.

Maintaining & adding features to existing tech debt will likely cost more in the long run.","Rewrites can seem like moving a mountain, but sometimes it's just a hill in disguise.

Legacy code is like an old house. Renovation often costs more than rebuilding.

What's usually underestimated is the hidden cost of maintaining complexity.

Thoughts on the emotional cost of sticking with the old?"

help me decide what to do with him","Mistakes are part of the learning curve. 

Instead of focusing on blame, consider turning this into a coaching moment. How can your team strengthen its safety nets to catch these errors early?

What safeguards could prevent a repeat?"
"2025-05-15T19:29:11.380Z","https://twitter.com/bhalligan/status/1923028262386589769","A founder asked me how he could develop thicker skin - more immunity to criticism.  Any advice here for him?","Criticism is a tool, not a weapon.  

Separate signal from noise. Look for patterns, not outliers.  

Think of feedback as iterative design.  

What's one piece of criticism that transformed your work?"
"2025-05-15T19:30:13.263Z","https://twitter.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1922985829841953277","Stop waiting for permission to live your best life. 

You don't need anyone's approval to do something different.

Yes it's hard, life isn't fair, and some people have it easier.

But it's your life, so assume responsibility.","Assuming responsibility is the ultimate power move.

It's like running open-source on your own life. You get to iterate and refine without waiting for a gatekeeper.

What's one small step you'll take today to start building your own narrative?"
"2025-05-15T19:31:15.830Z","https://twitter.com/theoliveranwar/status/1922970264704266288","A body with a high body fat percentage is a loan with a high-interest rate.

You'll pay for it later down the line.","Interesting analogy. Here's a thought: just like financial literacy can reduce debt, understanding nutrition can reshape health outcomes.

Both need a plan, discipline, and regular check‑ins. 

Ever considered how tech could streamline this learning process?"

While some swear by it for gains, others find it overkill. It's all about how it fits your routine.

What's your take on the balance between performance enhancement and natural growth?"

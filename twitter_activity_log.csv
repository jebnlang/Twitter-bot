Life will always be good to you.","Sounds like a solid checklist for a fulfilling life.

But here's a thought: what happens when life throws curveballs?

Adaptability might be the real MVP. How do you stay resilient when things don't go as planned?"

is like a 50-person company laying off 2 people","When a company scales, the human impact of layoffs doesn't scale down proportionally.  

Each role cut is a unique story and skill set lost.  

How do we ensure the human side of tech isn't overshadowed by numbers?"

Craftsmanship often hides in plain sight. 

Ever wondered how many people are stuck because they think they should already know something simple? 

That's the real opportunity."

But here's the real question: How does he treat waitstaff and baristas?  

Character is the real differentiator. 

Curious to see how people define golden retriever personality in real life!"

Maintaining & adding features to existing tech debt will likely cost more in the long run.","Rewrites can seem like moving a mountain, but sometimes it's just a hill in disguise.

Legacy code is like an old house. Renovation often costs more than rebuilding.

What's usually underestimated is the hidden cost of maintaining complexity.

Thoughts on the emotional cost of sticking with the old?"
